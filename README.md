# Reusable Constants and Variables

## Here is a link to the article about why this exists: 
[The overlooked area of coding](https://medium.com/@scott28479/the-overlooked-area-of-coding-b2c25579ca0f)

This is meant to be where everyone can share Constants and Variables, primarily static values. Also, there can be helper functions with the constants and variables.

If you don't like the coding style used for the file, there is no such thing as the right way to code. You should be flexible.

Areas Touched On:
- Canadian Provinces
- Certificate and Crypto
- Colors
- Countries
- Field Names
- HTTP settings
- PostgreSQL settings
- Statuses
- Time Codes and Timezones
- USA States

Additions are welcome for all programming languages. Also, if you want to add something and don't have the time to do it yourself, open an issue, and I will see if I can get to it. No promises.

For non-go-based code, please add the language to the directory name. Something like this: java-src. I'm open to other ways; let me know your thoughts.
